      <p>
        The Westminster Confession of Faith is a comprehensive statement of
        biblical doctrine crafted to articulate the core beliefs of the
        Christian faith. This historic confession serves as a guiding framework
        for understanding Godâ€™s sovereignty, salvation through Christ, the
        authority of Scripture, and the purpose of Christian living. Our church
        subscribes to the Westminster Confession because it faithfully reflects
        the teachings of the Bible, grounding us in the Reformed tradition while
        providing clarity and depth to our faith. By embracing this confession,
        we commit to worship and teaching that are Christ-centered, biblically
        sound, and rooted in a rich theological heritage.
