        The Chalcedonian Definition (AD 451) articulates the biblical teaching
        that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully man, two natures united in one
        person. This statement defends the truth of Christâ€™s incarnation against
        false teachings that sought to either separate or confuse His divine and
        human natures.

        We, then, following the holy Fathers, all with one consent, teach men to
        confess one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, the same perfect in
        Godhead and also perfect in manhood; truly God and truly man, of a
        reasonable soul and body; consubstantial with the Father according to
        the Godhead, and consubstantial with us according to the Manhood; in all
        things like unto us, without sin; begotten before all ages of the Father
        according to the Godhead, and in these latter days, for us and for our
        salvation, born of the Virgin Mary, the Mother of God, according to the
        Manhood; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only begotten, to be
        acknowledged in two natures, unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly,
        inseparably; the distinction of natures being by no means taken away by
        the union, but rather the property of each nature being preserved, and
        concurring in one Person and one Subsistence, not parted or divided into
        two persons, but one and the same Son, and only begotten, God the Word,
        the Lord Jesus Christ; as the prophets from the beginning have declared
        concerning Him, and the Lord Jesus Christ Himself has taught us, and the
        Creed of the holy Fathers has handed down to us.
