      <p>
        The Westminster Larger Catechism is a comprehensive teaching tool
        designed to provide a deeper and more detailed explanation of the
        Christian faith. Unlike <a
          class="italic text-blue-900 inline-block m-0"
          target="_blank"
          href="/beliefs/shorter-catechism">the Shorter Catechism</a
        >, which consists of 107 concise questions and answers for easy
        memorization, the Larger Catechism expands on these topics with greater
        depth and theological precision, making it particularly suited for
        advanced study and instruction. Both catechisms work together to
        summarize the Bibleâ€™s teachings, helping believers grow in their
        understanding of God, salvation, and Christian living. Our church
        subscribes to the Larger Catechism as part of its commitment to the
        rich, Christ-centered heritage of Reformed theology, ensuring that our
        doctrine and worship remain faithful to Scripture.
